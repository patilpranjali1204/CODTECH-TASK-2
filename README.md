Overview Of The Project:
This project involves creating a basic calculator program in Python that takes two numbers and an operation as input from the user, performs the selected operation, and displays the result.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this project is to create a simple calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
1.Define functions for each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
2.Prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation
3.Perform the selected operation using the defined functions
4.Display the result to the user

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
1.Python programming language
2.Built-in input() function for user input
3.Built-in print() function for output
4.Conditional statements (if-elif-else) for operation selection

KEY INSIGHTS:
1.The program uses functions to encapsulate each operation, making the code more modular and reusable.
2.The program uses conditional statements to select the correct operation based on the user's input.
3.The program handles division by zero by returning an error message.
4.The program uses the float data type to allow for decimal numbers as input.
