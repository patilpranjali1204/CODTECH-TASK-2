Overview Of The Project:
The project aims to develop a Python program that enables users to track and manage student grades efficiently. The program will allow users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as letter grade or GPA.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly Python program that can accurately track and manage student grades, providing a comprehensive overview of their academic performance.

Key Activities
1.Designing the Program Structure: Define the program's architecture, including the data structures and functions required to store and process student grades.
2.Implementing Grade Input and Storage: Develop a user interface to input grades for different subjects or assignments and store them in a suitable data structure.
3.Calculating Average Grade: Create a function to calculate the average grade based on the input grades.
4.Determining Letter Grade or GPA: Develop a function to convert the average grade into a letter grade or GPA, depending on the grading system used.
5.Displaying Results: Design a user-friendly output to display the overall grade, letter grade or GPA, and any additional relevant information.

Technologies Used
1.Python: The primary programming language used for developing the program.
2.Data Structures: Lists, dictionaries, or other suitable data structures will be used to store and process student grades.
3.Functions: Modular functions will be created to perform specific tasks, such as calculating the average grade and determining the letter grade or GPA.

Key Insights
1.Grading Systems: The program will need to accommodate different grading systems, such as letter grades (A-F) or GPA (4.0 scale).
2.Data Validation: Input validation will be essential to ensure that users enter valid grades and prevent errors in the program.
3.User Experience: A user-friendly interface will be designed to make it easy for users to input grades and access the results.
